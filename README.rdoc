*As a store owner, I want to create a new entry for a product with a name, price, and description.
*As a shopper, I want to see a list of all the products in the store, and be able to click on them to get more information.
*As a store owner, I want to make sure only I and other store employees can add, edit, and remove products. Hint: Add user authentication.
